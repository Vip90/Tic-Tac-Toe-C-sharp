"# Tic-Tac-Toe-C-sharp" 

  I liked to play tic-tac-toe with my friends, so I soon realized that it was a waste of paper for this type of game and then the idea comes to write a simple game to remind the basics of the c # language from my studies and starts again with programming. If time permits, the option to play with the computer will be added.


Technology : NET Framework 4.7.2
For play just download and run Tic-Tac-Toe-C-sharp-master\bin\Debug\Tic Tac Toe.exe
